# Event Store Documentation

**This documentation is available at <http://docs.getprooph.org/>.** Pages are built with [DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io).

What follows is documentation for how to use and contribute to the Event Store documentation. If youâ€™re planning to make updates or contributions then read on. Otherwise, head on over to the [website](http://docs.getprooph.org/).

### Documentation Theme

If you would like to improve the theme for the documentation site, then you can find its repository [here](https://github.com/prooph/docs-template).

### Running DocFX Locally

You can generate the site locally and test your changes. Follow the instructions [here](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html) to install DocFX and dependencies, then run:

```bash
docfx build docfx.json --serve
```

This builds the site to the `/_site` folder and serves it at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running DocFX with Docker

Assuming you have a directory `~/code/prooph` with 2 repositories there `documentation` and `docs-template`:

```bash
docker run -itv ~/code/prooph/:/tmp tsgkadot/docker-docfx:latest docfx build /tmp/documentation/docfx.json
```
